# CRISP overview

CRISP is an open-source Chrome extension which helps to select web elements on the page, automatically populate its selectors, assign configured actions and generate ready test code based on the customized patterns. It can speed up the process of test development by replacing manual time-consuming operations with automated features.

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Usage

Run `$ npm start` and load the `dist`-directory into chrome.

## Entryfiles (bundles)

There are two kinds of entryfiles that create bundles.

1. All ts-files in the root of the `./app/scripts` directory
2. All css-,scss- and less-files in the root of the `./app/styles` directory

## How to get started

To start using CRISP:
1. Launch Chrome browser.
2. Open Developer tools:
- Click “Customize and control Google Chrome” (3-dots icon)  at the status bar -> Select “More Tools” -> select “Developer Tools”;
- Or press Ctrl+Shift+I;
- Or press F12 key.
3. Open “Elements” tab.
4. Open "CRISP" sub-tab on the same level with the "Styles" sub-tab.
